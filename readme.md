# Final Project deploying a model remotely

The model can find the classification of pistachio by analyzing the model uploaded. The model has safeguards to avoid error generation. This is done by
introducing checkboxes. 
<br>
### **Both** checkbox must be checked before the upload button becomes available.
- The image must have a square aspect ratio.
- The image must have a 24-bit color depth.
> The following conditions must be met to run the program.

### The program outputs two class names.
- Kirmizi
- Siirt

- The model uses convolutional neural network, with sigmoid activation function to predict the pistachios species. It was trained on 1,717 pictures of pistachios.

- The image used is licensed under CC0.
